# Dodge or Die  
______________________________________  
## In this game, Player 1's goal is to reach the top of the screen. Player 2's goal is to stop that.	

### Rules:	
Player 1: WASD to move, Spacebar to jump. Reach the top somehow.  
Player 2: Left and Right arrow keys to move. You cannot control black boxes, but they have a different effect than the white boxes you do control.  
There are a limited amount of falling white and black boxes. Once the boxes are expended and Player 1 has not reached the top, then Player 2 wins. This game can also be played alone (but it will be less fun).  
  
While the best way is to play for yourself, here are some tips:  
* Kill yourself, because you can use your old bodies to climb to the top
* The black box is very powerful, as Player 2 you can often trap your opponent into resetting the game using the black box.
* Try to jump into the white boxes at the correct time instead of waiting for them to hit you.
