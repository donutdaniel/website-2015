        <ul>
          <li><strong>2005</strong> - Artist Matt Furie created the comic series Boy’s Club, which stars the teenage monster characters Pepe, Brett, Andy and Landwolf</li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - A comic in which Pepe pulls his pants down to his ankles in order to urinate was popularized on 4chan’s /b/, (random) board, along with the expression “Feels good man”</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - An edited version featuring a distraught-looking Pepe with the caption “Feels bad man” began circulating as a reaction image on 4chan and the Body Building Forums</li>
          <li><strong>2014</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>June 13th</strong> - PepeTheFrogBlog <a href="http://pepethefrogblog.tumblr.com/">Tumblr blog</a> was launched</li>
            <li><strong>October 25th</strong> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pepethefrog/">/r/pepethefrog subreddit</a> was launched for content featuring the frog character</li>
            <li><strong>December 7th</strong> - a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PepeTheSadFrog">Facebook page</a> for “Pepe the Frog” was created</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>2015</strong> - A phenomenon began on 4chan where users would declare certain variants as rare, known as a "rare Pepe". These images, sometimes as physical paintings, were put up for sale and auction on eBay and posted in listings on
            Craigslist.
          </li>
          <li><strong>2016</strong> - Associations of Pepe with Donald Trump's campaign, white nationalism, and the alt-right were described by various news organizations. The Anti-Defamation League included Pepe in its hate symbol database but noted that
            most instances of Pepe were not used in a hate-related context</li>
